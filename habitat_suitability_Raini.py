# # Habitat suitability under climate change
# 
# Our changing climate is changing where plant species can live,
# and conservation and restoration practices will need to take
# this into
# account.
# 
# In this coding challenge, you will create a habitat suitability model
# for a terrestrial plant species of your choice that lives in the contiguous United States
# (CONUS). We have this limitation because the downscaled climate data we
# suggest, the [MACAv2 dataset](https://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html),
# is only available in the CONUS – if you find other downscaled climate
# data at an appropriate resolution, you are welcome to choose a different
# study area. If you don’t have anything in mind, you can take a look at
# [*Sorghastrum nutans*](https://www.gbif.org/species/2704414), a grass native to North America. In the past 50
# years, its range has moved
# northward.
# 
# Your suitability assessment will be based on combining multiple data
# layers related to soil, topography, and climate, then applying a fuzzy logic model across the different data layers to generate habitat suitability maps. 
# 
# You will need to create a **modular, reproducible, workflow** using functions and loops.
# To do this effectively, we recommend planning your code out in advance
# using a technique such as a pseudocode outline or a flow diagram. We
# recommend breaking each of the blocks below out into multiple steps. It
# is unnecessary to write a step for every line of code unless you find
# that useful. As a rule of thumb, aim for steps that cover the major
# structures of your code in 2-5 line chunks.

# ## STEP 1: Study overview
# 
# Before you begin coding, you will need to design your study.
# 
# ### Step 1a: Select a species
# Select the terrestrial plant species you want to study, and research its habitat parameters in scientific studies or other reliable sources. Individual studies may not have the breadth needed for this purpose, so take a look at reviews or overviews of the data. Do **not** just look at an AI-generated summary! In the US, the National Resource Conservation Service can have helpful fact sheets about different species. University Extension programs are also good resources for summaries.</p>
# <p>Based on your research, select soil, topographic, and climate variables that you can use to determine if a particular location and time period is a suitable habitat for your species.</p></div></div>
# 
# **Reflect and respond**: 
# Write a description of your species. What habitat is it found in? What is its geographic range? What, if any, are conservation threats to the species? What data will shed the most light on habitat suitability for this species? 
# 
# What core scientific question do you hope to answer about potential future changes in habitat suitability? Don't forget to cite your sources!

# I'm interested in studying the Whitebark Pine (Pinus albicaulis). The Whitebark Pine is a charismatic, endangered tree found throughout the Northern Rocky and Cascade Mountains. The tree grows slowly and tends to grow in locations where other trees struggle to survive, such as drier, rockier locations higher on mountain ridges. 
# 
# Unfortunately, there are multiple major conservation risks to the Whitebark Pine, including Whitebark Blister Rust, pine beetles, and climate change. Blister Rust is an invasive fungus that kills trees over the course of 5-10 years, and has wiped out significant populations across the Rocky Mountains. Blister rust thrives in cooler, wetter climates, such as spring and fall. Pine beetles also pose a threat to the whitebark pine, as well as climate change. Both of these threats are bourne through rising temperatures; more beetles can survive milder winters, and higher temperatures decrease water availability and increase fire danger.
# 
# To begin studying this topic, I will investigate maximum temperature in the Whitebark Pine's habitat. This is obviously not the only variable affecting the tree, but it is a good place to start.

# Based on your research and/or range maps you find online, select at least 2 sites where your species occurs.

You can access protected area polygons from the [US Geological Survey's Protected Area Database](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/pad-us-data-overview), [national grassland units](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/shp/S_USA.NationalGrassland.zip), etc.
# 
# When selecting your sites, you might want to look for places that are marginally habitable for this species, since those locations will be most likely to show changes due to climate.

# %% [markdown]
# Your response here:
# 
# I will be studying Yellowstone, Glacier, and Mount Rainier National Parks. I've selected Yellowstone and Glacier as they are spatially close but geographically quite different. In addition, many Montanans relate to the Whitebark Pine, and I hope this study can offer some interesting information. In addition, I've added Mount Rainier, which, according to GBIF data, is fairly prolific in the park. In addition, it will be interesting to compare how populations in the Rocky Mountains and Cascades might differ. Each site has interesting characteristics that compare to the other parks. Yellowstone and Mount Rainier are at similar latitudes, but Yellowstone and Glacier are geographically closer.
# 
# I expect Yellowstone to see a major change in habitat suitability, and more modest changes in Glacier and Mount Rainier. Yellowstone is more arid, and there isn't as much vertical space for the trees to climb in the coming decades. On the other hand, Mount Rainier and Glacier are more temperate, which with a mid-century perspective might be beneficial.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Step 1c: Select time periods
# 
# In general when studying climate, we are interested in **climate
# normals**, which are typically calculated from 30 years of data so that
# they reflect the climate as a whole and not a single year which may be
# anomalous. So if you are interested in the climate around 2050, you will need to access climate data from 2035-2065.
# 
# **Reflect and Respond**: Select at least two 30-year time periods to compare, such as historical and 30 years into the future. These time periods should help you to answer your scientific question.

# %% [markdown]
# Your response here:
# 
# I will compare a relatively recent historical time period before climate change began to majorly accelerate (1970-2000), and a mid-century time period (2035-2065), which is close enough to be relevant to the lives of many residents and stakeholders around these parks.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Step 1d: Select climate models
# 
# There is a great deal of uncertainty among the many global climate
# models available. One way to work with the variety is by using an
# **ensemble** of models to try to capture that uncertainty. This also
# gives you an idea of the range of possible values you might expect! To
# be most efficient with your time and computing resources, you can use a
# subset of all the climate models available to you. However, for each
# scenario, you should attempt to include models that are:
# 
# -   Warm and wet
# -   Warm and dry
# -   Cold and wet
# -   Cold and dry
# 
# for each of your sites.
# 
# To figure out which climate models to use, you will need to access
# summary data near your sites for each of the climate models. You can do
# this using the [Climate Futures Toolbox Future Climate Scatter
# tool](https://climatetoolbox.org/tool/Future-Climate-Scatter). There is
# no need to write code to select your climate models, since this choice
# is something that requires your judgement and only needs to be done
# once.
# 
# If your question requires it, you can also choose to include multiple
# climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, and/or
# multiple emissions scenarios, such as RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
# 
# **Reflect and respond**: Choose at least 4 climate models that cover the range of possible future climate variability at your sites. Which models did you choose, and how did you make that decision?

# %% [markdown]
# Your response here (don't forget to cite the Climate Toolbox): 
# 
# The models I chose to use for this study are as follows: 
# 
# Glacier: [-114.47496141,   48.23369274, -113.24188594,   49.00110346]

# 
# Yellowstone: [-111.15593419,   44.13245333, -109.82419118,   45.10897528]
# - CD - IPSL-CM5B-LR 
# - CW - MRI-CGCM3

# - CD - MRI-CGM3
# - CW - GFDL-ESM2M
# - HD - HadGEM2-CC365
# - HW - CanESM2
# 
# I looked at the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, as that is the scenario the world is tracking most closely right now. I created a scatterplot on the [Climate Futures Toolbox](https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/vis_scatterplot.php) website using the bounds of each site's area to query the server. I looked at summer (June, July, August) temperatures versus winter precipitation (December, January, February), as the changes to these variables in their respective seasons will be quite impactful. I selected models that balanced both variables as best as possible.

# ### Step 2b: Topographic data
# 
# Depending on your species habitat needs/environmental parameters, you might be interested in elevation, slope, and/or aspect. You can access reliable elevation data from the [SRTM
# dataset](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm),
# available through the [earthaccess
# API](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/). Once you have elevation data, you can calculate slope and aspect.

# Notes:
# "In all but the driest regions, whitebark pine is most abundant on warm aspects and ridgetops having direct exposure to sun and wind. It is less abundant on sheltered, north-facing slopes and in cirque basins, where subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), mountain hemlock, or alpine larch (Larix lyallii) become prevalent. Nevertheless, the tallest and best formed whitebark pine trees are. often found in high basins or on gentle north slopes
# 
# It becomes increasingly abundant southward, especially in Montana and central Idaho. It is a major component of high-elevation forests and the timberline zone between about 1800 and 2500 m (5,900 and 8,200 ft) in northwestern Montana and 2130 and 2830 m (7,000 and 9,300 ft) in west-central Montana. In western Wyoming, it is abundant at 2440 to 3200 m (8,000 to 10,500 ft)." https://research.fs.usda.gov/silvics/whitebark-pine

# You can use MACAv2 data for historical and future climate data. Be sure
# to compare at least two 30-year time periods (e.g. historical vs. 10
# years in the future) for at least four of the CMIP models. Overall, you
# should be downloading at least 8 climate rasters for each of your sites,
# for a total of 16. **You will *need* to use loops and/or functions to do

# 
# https://research.fs.usda.gov/silvics/whitebark-pine
# Summers are short and cool with mean July temperatures ranging from 13° to 15° C (55° to 59° F) in the whitebark pine forest and from 10° to 12° C (50° to 54° F) in the adjacent timberline zone. A cool growing season, as defined by mean temperatures higher than 5.5° C (42° F) (11), lasts about 90 to 110 days in the whitebark pine forest, but light frosts and snowfalls sometimes occur even in mid-summer. The hottest summer days reach temperatures of 26° to 30° C (79° to 86° F). January mean temperatures range from about -9° C (15° F) in Montana to about -5° C (23° F) in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Long-term record low temperatures in Montana and Wyoming stands are probably -40° to -50° C (-40° to -58° F)
# Mean annual precipitation for most stands where whitebark pine is a major component probably is between 600 and 1800 mm (24 and 72 in)

# ## STEP 3: Harmonize data
# To use all your environmental and climate data layers together, you need to harmonize the different rasters you've downloaded and processed. 
# 
# As a first step, make sure that the grids for all the rasters match each other. Check out the <a href="https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/examples/reproject_match.html#Reproject-Match"><code>ds.rio.reproject_match()</code> method</a> from <code>rioxarray</code>. Make sure to use the data source that has the highest resolution as a template!</p></div></div>
# 
# > **Warning**
# >
# > If you are reprojecting data (as you need to here), the order of
# > operations is important! Recall that reprojecting will typically tilt
# > your data, leaving narrow sections of the data at the edge blank.
# > However, to reproject efficiently it is best for the raster to be as
# > small as possible before performing the operation. We recommend the
# > following process:
# >
# >     1. Crop the data, leaving a buffer around the final boundary
# >     2. Reproject to match the template grid (this will also crop any leftovers off the image)

# ## STEP 4: Develop a fuzzy logic model
# 
# A fuzzy logic model is one that is built on expert knowledge rather than
# training data. You may wish to use the
# [`scikit-fuzzy`](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/) library, which
# includes many utilities for building this sort of model. In particular,
# it contains a number of **membership functions** which can convert your
# data into values from 0 to 1 using information such as, for example, the
# maximum, minimum, and optimal values for soil pH.
# 
# To train a fuzzy logic habitat suitability model:</p>
# <pre><code>1. Find the optimal values for your species for each variable you are using (e.g. soil pH, slope, and current annual precipitation). 
# 2. For each **digital number** in each raster, assign a **continuous** value from 0 to 1 for how close that grid square/pixel is to the optimum range (1 = optimal, 0 = incompatible). 
# 3. Combine your layers by multiplying them together. This will give you a single suitability number for each grid square.
# 4. Optionally, you may apply a suitability threshold to make the most suitable areas pop on your map.</code></pre></div></div>
# 
# > **Tip**
# >
# > If you use mathematical operators on a raster in Python, it will
# > automatically perform the operation for every number in the raster.
# > This type of operation is known as a **vectorized** function. **DO NOT
# > DO THIS WITH A LOOP!**. A vectorized function that operates on the
# > whole array at once will be much easier and faster.

# Interpret your plots here:

# All of the plots appear to lack any suitability at all. This likely indicates a problem with the processing, as Glacier and Yellowstone are obviously suitable in many places for the Whitebark Pine. Based on investigation, I believe this issue is related to how I imported the files at one point, and I plan to return and solve this issue.
